                    An accounting and auditing firm based in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories first created in 
                    1969. I worked for Avery Cooper for 4 months as a summer intern, during this time I travelled 
                    to Iqaluit (NU), Fort Smith (NT), and Pangnirtung (NU) to conduct audits for government funded
                    businesses. Over my time I learnt how to conduct work in a professional manner and timely manner 
                    while also meeting some great people.

                    A tech security company based in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories founded over 40 years ago. I
                    worked for Arctic Alarm for around 1.5 years, during this time I conducted home and commercial security
                    system installations. Throughout my experience working here I developed my professional skills and 
                    honed in on advancing my technical knowledge of how systems work.

                    I worked in the finance department, Information Shared Systems Solutions divison of the Gov't of the 
                    Northwest Territories located in Yellowknife. During my time here I learnt so much about what a project
                    manager does and how a collective creates a website or application from the ground up. I also learnt 
                    how a provincial/territorial government in Canada operates and functions on multiple levels.
