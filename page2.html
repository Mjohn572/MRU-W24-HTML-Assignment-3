                <p>
                    Located in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories Sir John Franklin High School
                    is part of the YK1 school board. I attended this high school from 2013 to 2017
                    and earned my high school diploma. I regularly participated in extra caricular
                    activites like soccer, vollyball and badminton.

                    Located in Calgary, Alberta SAIT is the home to many great programs. I attended 
                    from 2017-2019 in my pursuit for a bachelor of business administration, and I 
                    majored in accounting. I eventually switched my degree and school, but the 
                    information I learned along the way helped me in understanding what makes a 
                    business successful.
